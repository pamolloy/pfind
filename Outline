System Interface:
    The find application uses fnmatch() to check whether a file or
    directory matches the pattern argument. This is also referenced in
    The Open Group base specification of find. However, the GNU manual
    states that using `fnmatch` "would be slow (and complex, since you
    would have to handle subdirectories by hand)."[1] Despite its
    recommendation, glob provides far more functionality than is
    necessary here.

    lstat is used instead of stat because following hard links may lead
    the application to run in a recursive loop if the link points to a
    file or directory higher in the directory tree.

Data Structures:
    Memory is allocated by malloc when building a new path for a
    subdirectory using the buildPath function and for the pointer array
    that is created in the search dir function. In the later case a
    chunk of memory is allocated based on the number of entries in a
    directory and the size of a character pointer. Then the filename
    in each entry is stored in a separate chunk of memory, the address
    of which is stored in the first chunk of memory (i.e. the "pointer
    array").
