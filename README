NAME
    pfind - a simplified version of `find'

SYNOPSIS
    pfind [path] [ -name <expression>] [ -type <c>]

DESCRIPTION
    This simplified version of the find command. It accepts three
    optional arguments; path, expression and type.

    Exactly one starting directory must be specified.

    Each option may be specified in its long form, with either a single
    or double dash, or in its short form, which consists of a single
    dash and the first character of the flag name. A long option may
    take a parameter, of the form --arg=param or --arg param.

    If any a flag appears more than once pfind prints a syntax error to
    standard error.

DATA STRUCTURES
    Memory is allocated by malloc when building a new path for a
    subdirectory using the buildPath function and for the pointer array
    that is created in the search dir function. In the later case a
    chunk of memory is allocated based on the number of entries in a
    directory and the size of a character pointer. Then the filename
    in each entry is stored in a separate chunk of memory, the address
    of which is stored in the first chunk of memory (i.e. the "pointer
    array").

REQUIRED
    The find application uses fnmatch() to check whether a file or
    directory matches the pattern argument. This is also referenced in
    The Open Group base specification of find. However, the GNU manual
    states that using `fnmatch` "would be slow (and complex, since you
    would have to handle subdirectories by hand)."[1] Despite its
    recommendation, glob provides far more functionality than is
    necessary here.

    lstat is used instead of stat because following hard links may lead
    the application to run in a recursive loop if the link points to a
    file or directory higher in the directory tree.

EXAMPLE
    Recursively search the directory `/home/s/smith' for a file named
    `core' of any type.
        $ pfind /home/s/smith -name core

    Recursively search the current working directory for a regular file
    with a name ending in `.c'.
        $ pfind . -name \*.c -type f

    Print the path for all files and subdirectories. It does not stop
    until it has searched all subdirectories.
        $ pfind cscie215/hw

BUGS
    Since this simplified version of find uses getopt to parse options
    in the command line, the errors that are printed for invalid or
    missing flags differ from that of GNU find. For example, pfind will
    print:
        pfind: option `-name' requires an argument
    to stderr, while find will print:
        find: missing argument to `-name'

    The searchdir and checkFile functions exceed the maximum function
    length of 30 lines by 33 and 11 lines each.

    The error handling for the access function on line 224 does not
    check errno. Instead it assumes if an error occurred it was a
    permission error.
