RECURSIVE PROGRAMS
    Other unix programs that operate recursively on directory trees
    include chown, rsync, scp, tree, dir, and vdir.

    dir     dir -R      List contents of subdirectories recursively
    tree    tree        List contents of directories in a tree-like
                        format
    scp     scp -r      Recursively copy entire directories over SSH
                        and it follows symbolic links
    rsync   rsync -r    Recursively copy the contents of directories
    chown   chown -R    Change the user and/or group of files and
                        directories recursively

    The tree application will recursively list the contents of
    directories by default, but it also has a -R flag, which will
    execute itself once it has reached a user defined depth in the
    directory tree.

    The mount application has a set of flags to recursively change the
    type of all mounts under a given mountpoint.

    Other applications I found by searching die.net include clamscan,
    gconftool, ifnotifywatch, wget, diff, dnotify, and feh.
